It defines how software   components should interact and helps to simplify software development by   abstracting the underlying implementation. APIs are essential for building   complex and interconnected software systems.       ## Contact Us     If you have problems or questions, please read the following information:     - [FAQ](https://www.logistiqo.com/faq/)    - [Contact us](https://www.logistiqo.com/contact.php)     To stay informed about the latest developments, you can     - Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/logistiqo/),
