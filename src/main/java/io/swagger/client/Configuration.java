 * An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of protocols, routines, and tools that enable different software applications to communicate and exchange data with each other. It defines how software components should interact and helps to simplify software development by abstracting the underlying implementation. APIs are essential for building complex and interconnected software systems.
